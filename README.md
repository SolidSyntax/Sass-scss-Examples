# Sass scss examples

An overview of scss features.

### Getting Started

main.scss imports snippets of scss code.  
main.css contains the compiled result.  

The snippets are located in the partials folder and bundled by feature.

To compile the scss to css yourself you must install Sass.

Install ruby, afterwards:
```
> sudo gem install sass
> sass --watch main.scss:main.css
```
